# 🤖 Python Agent Project

Welcome to your Agentuity Python Agent project! This README provides essential information to help you get started with developing, testing, and deploying your AI agents.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **UV**: Version 0.5.25 or higher ([Documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Authentication

Before using Agentuity, you need to authenticate:

```bash
agentuity login
```

This command will open a browser window where you can log in to your Agentuity account.

### Creating a New Agent

To create a new agent in your project:

```bash
agentuity agent new
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your agent.

### Development Mode

Run your project in development mode with:

```bash
agentuity dev
```

This will start your project and open a new browser window connecting your Agent to the Agentuity Console in Live Mode, allowing you to test and debug your agent in real-time.

You can also start your project in development mode without connecting to the Agentuity Console:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

## 🌐 Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your agent to the Agentuity Cloud:

```bash
agentuity deploy
```

This command will bundle your agent and deploy it to the cloud, making it accessible via the Agentuity platform.

## 📚 Project Structure

```
├── agents/             # Agent definitions and implementations
├── .venv/              # Virtual environment (created by UV)
├── .agentuity/         # Agentuity configuration files
├── pyproject.toml      # Project dependencies and metadata
├── server.py           # Server entry point
└── agentuity.yaml      # Agentuity project configuration
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Your project configuration is stored in `agentuity.yaml`. This file defines your agents, development settings, and deployment configuration.

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Environment Variables

You can set environment variables for your project:

```bash
agentuity env set KEY=VALUE
```

### Secrets Management

For sensitive information, use secrets:

```bash
agentuity env set --secret KEY=VALUE
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

To deploy this agent in a production environment (non-interactive, headless, or cloud):

### 1. Generate Gmail OAuth Token Locally
- Run the agent locally and complete the OAuth browser flow. This will generate a `token.json` file containing your refresh token.
- You should already have your `credentials.json` from the Google Cloud Console.

### 2. Set Required Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in your production environment (e.g., in your `.env` file, secret manager, or deployment config):

```
GOOGLE_AUTH_TOKEN=<contents of your token.json>
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<your Slack bot token>
DMARC_CHANNEL_ID=<your Slack channel ID>
AGENTUITY_SDK_KEY=<your Agentuity SDK key>
```

- To get the value for `GOOGLE_AUTH_TOKEN`, open your `token.json` and copy its entire contents (including braces `{}`) as a single line or valid JSON string.
- (Optional) If you want to avoid using a `credentials.json` file, you can also store its contents in an environment variable (e.g., `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON`) and update your code to use it.

### 3. Deploy Your Code
- Ensure your environment variables are set and accessible to your app.
- Deploy your codebase to your production with `agentuity deploy`

### 4. Run Your App
- Copy and paste the link generated by the previous `agentuity deploy` to your browser. If you cannot find it - visit your agentuity dashboard and find your DMARC project.
- Set up webhook or cron job for your `dmarc_email` agent -- you can find that in `Agents` tab of your DMARC project.

**Note:** You do NOT need to run the OAuth browser flow in production. As long as your `GOOGLE_AUTH_TOKEN` is valid and contains a refresh token, your app will authenticate and refresh tokens automatically.
